I'm a passionate Full Stack Web developer who loves to do experiments, liked to clone websites and always hungry for learning new things👨🏼‍💻. Some technologies that I enjoy to working with includes MERN stack ( MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS ), Typescript and testing. I have learned couple of CSS libraries like Bootstrap and styled-components. I'm currently digging dip into javascript and working on some solo projects✨. My interests includes plantation, sky gazing and exploring web3😄.
